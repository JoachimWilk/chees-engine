# Chess-engine in Python

## General info

I wanted to implement chess in Python. Then, I came across a tutorial by Eddie Sharick, who made a whole 16 episodes series covering the topic. This repository is a result of following his videos.
Hereby, I highly encourage you to visit his YouTube channel and check the whole series by yourself.

This is my exercise to learn programing skills in Python. All the credit goes to Eddie Sharick.
